# Credits

The maintainers, contributors, and members of this guild would like to thank the following for essential prior contributions.

Without these foundation blocks, our chain would not be able to grow tall and thick.

### GNU

So basic, even git wouldn't work without it, the GNU toolkit is used extensively by gitguild.
Additionally, the GNU standards were inspirational for a number of example documents and formats.

### Linux Foundation's Core Infrastructure Initiative

The greatest source of standards and example documents is definitely the CII. This includes but is not limited to the CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, CREDITS, and AUTHORS file formats.

### git

If there is one core foundation to the gitguild stack, it has to be git.
Git is the water that guilds swim in. Thank you git for the open ocean, full of diverse ecosystems.

### GnuPG

There is a saying "don't roll your own crypto." Thanks to GnuPG, we have an almost universally respected, flexible crypto backbone.
Thank you GnuPG for doing the heavy lifting, and carrying the weight to git, email, and so many other areas.

### Ledger-cli

How do you herd cats? Count them very carefully. Twice. Thanks to ledger-cli, the perfect plaintext accounting system was ready and waiting to drop into a git repo for version control.

### gitolite

Gitolite was a late find but natural fit for gitguild development. Comprehensive permissions inside a git repo, including ssh keyring... it is just begging to be decentralized.
We're honored to try extending gitolite into a P2P network.
